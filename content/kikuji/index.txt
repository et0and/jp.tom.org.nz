text: Kikuji is a minimal WordPress theme built for artists and writers. 

It is forked from Piper Haywood's excellent Notebooks WP theme but with a focus on readability by default. It uses the Inter typeset by Rasmus Andersson, made for high legibility on computer screens (great for long-form blog posts or articles!)
