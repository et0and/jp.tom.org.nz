text: [Performa](https://www.are.na/tom/performa) is a performance art archive conducted and hosted on [are.na](https://are.na). It's main purpose is to serve my own research into different practitioners of performance and moving image work, but also with the intention of acting as a educational resource for others. 

While similar boards and collections exist on Pinterest, I have found that the site prevents users from accessing content beyond a certain point (unless they sign up for an account). It holds content hostage that is essentially being resisted from other websites, then injecting ads and tracking with it. 

This board is open and compliant with the [are.na API](http://dev.are.na) - use it however you want!
