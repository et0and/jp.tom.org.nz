text: Gaia is a proof-of-concept mass recycling and upcycling app built on top of [Telegram](https://telegram.org), aimed at reducing landfill waste in TƒÅmaki Makaurau Auckland. 

Leveraging existing commercial services by [Terracycle](https://terracycle.com), [Upcycle](http://www.upcycle.co.nz/) and [Abilities](https://www.abilities.co.nz/), Gaia acts as a middleman for those wanting to responsibly dispose of the following items:

- Dolce Gusto Nespresso Capsules
- Plastic toothbrushes
- Toothpaste packaging
- Compostable coffee cups and lids
- Coffee bags (Supreme, Kokako, Peoples)
- LCD televisions 
- Plasma televisions
- CRT box televisions 
- Laptops
- Desktop computers
- Printers and ink cartridges
- Cellphones
- GLAD ziplock bags 
- GLAD wrap (or equivalent)
- Batteries (AA, AAA, car)


The app and project is still in active development, with plans to create a carbon neutral (or negative) means of collecting waste from households. One idea is to use a zero emissions utility vehicle such as the [Nissan EV NV200](https://electrek.co/2018/04/24/nissan-e-nv200-electric-van-new-40-kwh-battery-pack/). Any further suggestions and feedback would be highly appreciated.
