text: Fujinuma Komon® is a clothing label started in September 2019, where I act as one of the designers. 

Run as a collective of friends as well as being a fashion experiment, FK® is an attempt at a kind of clothing that is part minimalism, part pragmatism but mostly tongue-in-cheek.

A lookbook will be released later in the year of the debut SS19 collection.
