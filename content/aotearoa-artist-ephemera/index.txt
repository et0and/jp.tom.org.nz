text: [Aotearoa Artist Ephemera (AAE)](https://www.are.na/kommons-werkstatt/aotearoa-artist-ephemera) is an online archive hosted on [are.na](https://are.na) of artist and gallery ephemera from Aotearoa New Zealand, dating from the early 1970s to the present day. This is an ongoing effort by myself and Komon Fujinuma under the [Kommons Werkstatt](https://www.kommons.org) umbrella.
