text: [Some Quiet Tips](https://some.quiet.tips) is an online resource designed to help those looking for some quiet time-out in their lives, if only for a brief moment. The design follows a simple chat interface, allowing for information to unfold as a “conversation” thread that can be looked through one piece at a time (inspired by [this great article by Benjamin Keyser](https://www.intercom.com/blog/killer-feature-messaging-no-ones-talking/)).
